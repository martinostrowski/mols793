CBMS793 markdown-formatted tutorials for this course have converged on the format and philosophy of the [Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org). As of 2018 the Advanced Biomolecular Analysis tutorials have been merged into the Carpentries lesson templates and we acknowledge the many contributors that have refined and curated the  templates that render our markdown tutorials as lesson web pages. In recognition of the Carpentries and the importance of **Reproducible Research** and to improve the **core skills** component of this course an introduction to GitHub has been incorporated into the practical for week 8. The format of these lesson templates should become familiar enough that you will be comfortable, and capable, of working through some of the material outside of class.

Several SWCarpentry episodes covering the basics of bash and Github are embedded in the class lessons and a very small number of episodes are set as homework.

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

        <li>Download the mobaxterm for Windows <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net">installer</a>.</li>
        <li>Run the installer and follow the instructions
          <ol>

          </ol>
        </li>

      </ol>
      <p>This will provide you with the Mobaxterm program that will allow you to connect to the server and transfer files.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">macOS</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.
        You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

        <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
        for example when installing R packages.
